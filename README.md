This folder contains the code for quantum neural networks and quantum transformers based on Photonic Analog Quantum Computing. 

Quantum computing is a method of computation that utilizes physical mediums operating on the principles of quantum mechanics. There are two types of quantum computing: 
* digital quantum computing: quantizing digital computing based on the binary logic
* analog quantum computing: using the continuous (analog) properties of nature.
The difference between digital (discrete) quantum computing and analog (continuous) quantum computing is stated in this paper: [Quantum computing overview](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07246).

The actual implementation of analog quantum computing (AQC) was realized by Xanadu in 2020. The architecture of the AQC chip actualized using quantum optics can be found in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02109).

Photonic Analog Quantum Computing has the following benefits:
* Compatible with the existing communications infrastructure.
* Operates at room-temperature.
* Higher dimensional computation space.
* Easy to network and multiplex
* Low cost of mass production
* Mountable on smartphones, laptops, and edge devices.

Using the displacement and nonlinear phenomena in quantum optics, one can faithfully implement a quantum version of Artificial Neural Networks and Photonic AQC. This repo contains the code of Quantum Neural Networks and Quantum Transformers.
