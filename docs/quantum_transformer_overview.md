## Quantum Transformer

Ever since the Transformer model was introduced in the seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., in 2017, we saw an explotion of advancement in Generative AI starting from ChatGPT in 2022.

Overview
The Transformer model is designed to handle sequential data, entirely relying on a mechanism called self-attention to draw global dependencies between input and output. This mechanism allows for "parallelization" of data for efficient processing.

Key Components
Self-Attention Mechanism:

Scaled Dot-Product Attention: The core of the attention mechanism, it computes the attention weights using the dot product of the query (Q) and key (K) matrices, scales it by the square root of the dimension of the key, and then applies a softmax function.
Multi-Head Attention: Instead of performing a single attention function, the Transformer employs multiple attention heads to capture information from different representation subspaces.
Positional Encoding:

Since the Transformer does not use recurrent structures, it incorporates positional encoding to give the model information about the position of each token in the sequence.
Layer Structure:

Encoder: Consists of a stack of identical layers, each with two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. Each sub-layer has residual connections followed by layer normalization.
Decoder: Also consists of a stack of identical layers with three sub-layers: an additional multi-head self-attention mechanism over the encoder's output, in addition to the two sub-layers found in each encoder layer.
Feed-Forward Neural Networks:

Each encoder and decoder layer has a fully connected feed-forward network, applied to each position separately and identically.
Residual Connections and Layer Normalization:

Residual connections help in training deep networks, and layer normalization helps stabilize the learning process.

Benefits
Parallelization: Unlike RNNs, Transformers allow for parallel computation, significantly speeding up training times.
Long-Range Dependencies: Self-attention mechanism enables the model to learn long-range dependencies more effectively than RNNs.
Applications
The Transformer model has revolutionized NLP and has been the foundation for many state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT, and T5. Its applications range from machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis to more complex tasks like question answering and language generation.
